 # 0x11.C - printf

## Description

The project `0x11. C - printf` involves implementing a simplified version of the `printf` function in C. The `printf` function in C is used for formatted output, allowing the user to print data with specified formatting, such as decimal places, field width, and more. This project provides hands-on experience in understanding and creating a basic version of this important function.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the functionality and purpose of the `printf` function in C.
- Implement a simplified version of the `printf` function to handle various format specifiers.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with specific options (`-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`).
- All files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project.
- Code must follow the specific style guide (e.g., Betty style for C).

## Usage

To use the custom  `printf` function, include the `main.h` header file in your C file and call the function.
